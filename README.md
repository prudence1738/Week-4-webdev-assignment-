## üìÇ Project Structure

## üñ•Ô∏è Responsiveness
- **Desktop (default):** Two-column grid layout with horizontal navigation and flexible cards.  
- **Tablet (‚â§ 900px):** Grid proportions adjusted; navigation spreads evenly.  
- **Mobile (‚â§ 600px):** Grid collapses to a single column, navigation switches to vertical, and cards stack.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for semantic structure.  
- **CSS3** for styling and layout.  
- **Flexbox** for one-dimensional alignment (navigation + cards).  
- **CSS Grid** for two-dimensional layout (content + sidebar).  
- **Media Queries** for responsive design.

## üöÄ How it Works
1. **Header & Navigation:** Flexbox aligns navigation items horizontally on desktop and vertically on mobile.  
2. **Main Layout:** CSS Grid creates two columns for content and sidebar on larger screens; collapses to one column on mobile.  
3. **Card Section:** Flexbox allows cards to wrap and resize based on available screen width.  
4. **Footer:** Stays at the bottom and stretches full width; simple and clean design.
